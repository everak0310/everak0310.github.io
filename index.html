                <h3>User Interview</h3>
                <p>Interviewing user was a very helpful user research methodology to gain insights about how I should design the online portfolio and what elements should be displayed on the website. During my user interview, I asked user’s basic information to gain a better understanding of the user.I also asked what features should online portfolio have, expectation from the user and finally any concerns regarding using the online portfolio to design a appropriate the website. </p>

                    <h3>Competitor Analysis</h3>
                    <p>I have conducted a competitor analysis on multiple websites to gain a better understanding of the competitors and seek any useful information that can be incorporated into my online portfolio. I have checked three three online portfolio websites and one product website as my indirect competitor. Three online portfolio websites was analyzed to gain a better understanding of how other portfolio websites are designed and what elements those website included for their visitors. A product website was analyzed to have a better understanding of how the product was advertised on the website and what kind of information was presented in what form of content. </p>

                        <h3>Future Value Matrix</h3>
                        <p>Feature value matrix is a technique that gives designers the ability to prioritize potential feature in your product, to reduce ‘my favorite feature bias’ from development, and to lay out a product roadmap and how it can balance the market requirements with realistic development. I have selected contact by email, Navigation menu feature, resume, projects pages, bio, gallery, social media links and responsive design. Selected features were the most important features to design and develop an online portfolio based on my user interview, and competitors analysis. </p>
